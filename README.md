## Example to demonstrate redux-loop with TypeScript

This project is simplified version of [redux loop ts example](https://github.com/meandmax/redux-loop-ts-example). It uses typescript 2.8 [conditional types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html) therefore matching actions in reductor is much easier. Actions were put together with reducer following [Ducks: Redux Reducer Bundles](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) pattern.

## run it
